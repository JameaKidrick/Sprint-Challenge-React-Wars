1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

ReactJS is a library that allows us to write and send software quickly. We don't have to work in multiple files to create an app now. We can markup, style, and add functionality through JS using ReactJS.

1. What does it mean to think in react?

    It means to develop, in mind, what you want your app be. You're mentally building it and breaking it down into components which you will use React to build.

1. Describe state.

    State is simply the data we are trying to display.

1. Describe props.

    Props is an object we use to help build components that share data (state).

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

    Side effects are data that is outside of the function scope (example: api). You sync effects using the effect hook `useEffect` which helps us manage these side effects.
